// Determines how many years a user has left to live on each planetâ€¦ (yikes!) To do this, the application will have to calculate the user's life expectancy. You can determine average life expectancy as you see fit. A simple way to do this would be to have the user input the average life expectancy for their demographic. A more involved way to do this would be to collect other information from the user (e.g. lifestyle, country of residence, activity level, etc.) to determine their life expectancy.
