#### By Morgan Waites

## Technologies Used

* Javascript/JQuery
* HTML/CSS/Bootstrap 

## Description

Webpage where user inputs age on Earth and it displays age in years on some planets along with corresponding years remaining on planets based on human average life expectancy.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* In terminal, navigate to desktop or desired place to hold project folder
* git clone this repository
* navigate to top level of project folder, super-galactic-age-calculator
* npm install
* npm run start

## Known Bugs

* It lacks accuracy as it rounds age results up, doesn't account for months of age only years so age on planets not exact. A way around this would be to force user to enter exact birthday, and make it a float, and make a fuction that rounds up to two decimal points for more accuracy.
